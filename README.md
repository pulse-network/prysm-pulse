# Prysm-Pulse: A PulseChain Consensus Client Written in Go

This is the core repository for Prysm-Pulse, a [Golang](https://golang.org/) implementation of the [Ethereum Consensus](https://ethereum.org/en/eth2/) specification, originally developed by [Prysmatic Labs](https://prysmaticlabs.com) and modified for usage with [PulseChain](https://pulsechain.com/). See the [Changelog](https://gitlab.com/pulsechaincom/prysm-pulse/-/releases) for details of the latest releases and upcoming breaking changes.

### Getting Started

A detailed set of installation and usage instructions as well as breakdowns of each individual component are available in the [official documentation portal](https://docs.prylabs.network). If you still have questions, feel free to join [our telegram channel](https://t.me/PulseDEV).

### Staking on Mainnet

To participate in staking, you can join the [PulseChain staking launchpad](https://pulsechain.com/). The launchpad is the only recommended way to become a validator. You can explore validator rewards/penalties via the PulseChain [beacon chain explorer](https://www.pulsechain.com), and follow the latest blocks added to the chain on [block explorer](https://www.pulsechain.com).
